# What is Sustainability?

![Sustainability image](/assets/images/SDG.png#pull-right#w360)
Sustainability is nothing new and the very concept of Sustainability has been known as a legal term since 1907. 

When we today talk about sustainability, we most often use the definition from the UN's Bruntland report “Our common Future” from 1987, where sustainability is described as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”

When it comes to sustainability, words like CSR / ESG, Circular Economy, Biodegradable, CO2 neutral, SDG, SEDEX, Global Compact and Science Based Targeting you hear - and new expressions are constantly emerging. 

It is important to emphasize that sustainability is the interaction between: 
* climate, environment and biodiversity, 
* occupational health and social security 
* services and goods as generated by the organization 

And that the above must be seen both in the context of individual organization and in its interaction with the outside world. Sustainability is therefore a cross-organizational discipline and not a task that is solved by a single employee (group) or CO2 compensation.
