# Food Safety and Quality Management

Karin has worked with quality and food safety standards for over 20 years, starting out with basic HACCP implementation in 1996.

For the past 8 years, it has primarily been the GFSI (Global Food Safety Initiative) recognized food safety standards she has been working with, such as ISO22000 FSSC, BRC and IFS within both food production, storage and transport.

FoodEfficiency can help both in the design and implementation of a food safety system, by switching from one standard to another or cleaning up a system that has grown unmanageable over time. 
Furthermore, we also conduct supplier audits, as part of general supplier management, in the event of complaints or 3rd part manufacturing / contract manufacturing approval.
