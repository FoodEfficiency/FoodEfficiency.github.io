# How we work

The key word through all working relationships and projects has been knowledge sharing and value creation and this is what drives my mind-set and approach to new tasks. 

When implementing a standard or documenting its sustainability performance, it must provide value for the company, its strategy, in the context in which it is located and among its employees and stakeholders. 

Quality and sustainability should therefore not just be a certificate on the wall or a 20-page report that very few read. 

# Example of tasks
* Advisor and facilitator – in the preparation of strategies and objectives 
* Training provider - introduction to sustainability and food safety
* External manager – food safety, quality and environmental management systems
* Interim manager / project employment - 2-4 days a week depending on duration. 
*Consultant - for establishing, developing or reorganization of management systems
