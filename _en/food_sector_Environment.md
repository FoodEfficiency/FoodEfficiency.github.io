Karin has extensive experience developing environmental goals and objectives, environmental reporting as well as internal and external communication on the environment and climate. 
She was responsible for establishing Arla Foods' British environmental organization, including communication, reporting and knowledge sharing.

In recent years, focus has been on water consumption and reduction, waste water and product disposal mainly within the food sector, often within the scope of ISO14000 and UN's Sustainable Development Goals.
