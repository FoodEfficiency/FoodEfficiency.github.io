# Hygiene and compliance with Danish Food Safety law

Companies that handle or import food in Denmark must be registered with the Danish Food Safety Administration and document the necessary control and handling of their food related activities.

This applies for restaurants and canteens, production premises and warehouses to ensure documentation of various activities such as traceability and cleaning as well as the preparation of a “egenkontrolprogram” (self-inspection program).

FoodEfficiency is approved by the food safety administration as advisor in the food requirements both in establishment and operation of companies and if you get a “rådgiver påbud” (administrative warning with a demand to seek professional consultancy) as outcome of an inspection.
