# Production transfer and outsourcing

Whether it is product transfers or licensed production within food production, it rarely happens as a 1: 1 transfer, as many different factors affect the final quality. 
It is therefore important from the beginning to define the critical parameters for the product and also how they are measured and documented. 

Furthermore, it must be ensured that conditions such as factory design, GMP and traceability are correctly implemented and that the employee has the necessary knowledge and training to handle the production tasks. 

Karin has been involved in a number of production and product transfers at both Arla Foods, SPX Flow and LEGO, and can help ensure a successful production transfer or subcontracting.
