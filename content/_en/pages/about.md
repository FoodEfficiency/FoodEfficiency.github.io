# About - FoodEfficiency

![Food Efficiency v/Karin Hansen - Start Up][1]
**FoodEfficiency** was established in July 2012 as an independent consultant within quality, environment, working environment and sustainability. The customer base is primarily in the food supply chain where we have over 20 years of international experience.

Experience witth the high demands for traceability through the food supply chain also make **FoodEfficiency** an attractive partner for other industries that want to strengthen cooperation with customers, suppliers and subcontractors across the supply chain, e.g. with a focus on quality and sustainability.

**FoodEfficiency** is owned by Karin Hansen, who has a MSc in dairy engineering with a supplementary MSc technical environmental management from DTU.

Since 1996, Karin Hansen has been involved in quality, environment, safety, product development and project management in Denmark and abroad. It is from these experiences that she now advises small and medium-sized companies in the field of food safety and sustainability.

In addition, Karin is a certified BRC 3rd party auditor for supplier audits, ISO22000 FSSC Lead auditor and approved advisor according to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration's advisor list.
