Nine years ago I wrote my first article on Sustainability in the Danish Dairy and Food Industry World Wide Magazine. "[2012_Alectia Danish Dairy & Food Industry][1]"

Whilst some companies have gone a long way since then others are about to start the journey. For both it is important not only to focus on sustainability in your own organisation but just as important in your contribution and responsibility within your supply chain.

E.g for a manufacture of cleaning tools it can be relevant to minimize material usage in its design and production waste at the factory, but also securing safe and ergonomic working routines, high degree of cleaning efficiency and hygiene and thereby minimising food waste, improving working conditions and minimizing water usage within the customers organization.

Sustainability is not a stand-alone activity managed by a CSR group but the responsibility of the entire organisation and its stakeholders and something we all must work with now and in the new year.
