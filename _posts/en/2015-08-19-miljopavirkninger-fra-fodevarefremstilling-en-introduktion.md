What are the environmental impact from food processing, what are they related to, what are the alternatives and how are they managed. 

We have written a short introduction to this area - also describing the environmental impact from processing within the ovreall food chain from farm to fork. [The document can be found here.][1]{:target="_blank"}

The new ISO14001:2015 standard will focus on the context of the organisation and therefore also the environmental contribution to  the food chain. Furthermore the new standard also promotes a common apporach and risk-based thinkng to integrate its enviromental management system with the requirements of other management systems. More information on the new revised standard will follow on our news page.

If you wish to reduce your environmental impact but keeping a high focus on quality and food safety please contact us for further discussion on how we can support you on this journey.
