Within the Food & Drink sector special attention should be paid to water usage and waste water disposal. Not only because this represents a significant cost to the industry but also because there is much potential in reusing waster as well as minimizing the amount of dairy waste.

FoodEfficiency has produced a small document, including recent environmental KPI's for the Dairy sector, on Water Usage, Waste Water and Biogas. This [document can be downloaded here.][1]{:target="_blank"}

An initial water and waste water survey is always recommended before larger changes to a dairy processing plant are made, to ensure that legal requirements are being complied with and that product waste does not become a waste water cost.

FoodEfficiency has several years of experience in conducting independent water and waste water surveys, please contact us for an informal quote.
