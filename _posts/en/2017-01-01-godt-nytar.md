![2017][1]

FoodEfficiency wishes all our clients, partners and colleagues a wonderful and prosperous new year.

Our activities will be stepped down over the year down due to new career opportunities - but if you have a question or comment concerning food safety, environmental management or sustainability within the food value chain you are still very welcome to contact us. 

We can still give a quick advise or direct you to relevant sources for further information.
