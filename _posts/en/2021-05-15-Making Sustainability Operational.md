Sustainability is more than climate and CO2.

Raw material utilization, nutrition, education, logistics are some of the areas that the food industry has worked with for decades, and which also support sustainable development, globally as well as locally.

Under the framework of our ISO management systems (quality, food safety, environment and occupational health and safety), we have a structure for how we plan, execute, measure, evaluate and continuously improve our performances, and this helps us implementing sustainability in our operation.

This structure focus on
- Context of the organisation
- Leadership
- Planning
- Support
- Operation
- Performance evaluation
- Improvement

These focus areas can easily be adapted supporting sustainable development of business and organisation.

Framework and examples are described in our recent article and you are welcome to contact us for further information and consultation.
