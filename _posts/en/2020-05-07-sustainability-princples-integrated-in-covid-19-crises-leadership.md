COVID-19 has shown how vulnerable we are both as individuals and organizations. However the good news is that COVID-19 has demonstrated the value of effective collaboration across the food supply chain, as well as the value of preparedness and creativity among employees, suppliers and customers.

Much has been successful with the changes that have been made - but mistakes have been made mistakes, e.g. disinfectants with allergens and carcinogens, ethanol produced on plants without the necessary safety assessments and approvals (such as ATEX) and employees who are forced to work without the company providing necessary protective equipment or planning the work in a safe manner.

Most likely, the companies that most smooth through the crisis will also be the ones that have incorporated UN sustainability principles as well as the UN's Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) into their business strategy, with some SDG's being the more eye-catching targets at the moment;

![FE For A Sustainable World][1]
* #2   Zero hunger
* #3   Good health and well-being
* #6   Clean water and sanitation
* #17 Partnership for the goals

This may be demonstrated by increased supplier cooperation, dialogue with employees about planning and safety, and involvement in the local communities in the areas where they act.

Sustainability is important for all companies, regardless of size, but often SMEs are struggling to understand the concept and seeing the opportunities of how the SDG's can help to develop their business in a sustainable way. 

FoodEfficiency has many years of experience with CSR management in SMEs and would like to have a dialogue with you about how your company can move forward with sustainability focus. Read more about our approach working towards a sustainable future on our [web-page.][2]{:target="_blank"}
