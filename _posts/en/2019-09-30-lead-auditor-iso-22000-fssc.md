Just returned after an intense week on the Lead Auditor course in ISO22000: 2018 FSSC at Campden BRI in England. 

![FSSC Course][1]

It was incredibly beneficial to get through all the requirements of ISO22000: 2018, ISO22001: 2009 and FSSC ver. 5 and see the coherence of requirements across the three standards, thus better equipped to develop systems for customers to ensure the efficiency of management system
