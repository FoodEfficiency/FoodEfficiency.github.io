FSSC has recently issued a guidance document for ISO 22000:2018 interpretation and I would like to draw attention to the appendix of the document "[Decision tree for the selection and categorisation of PRPs, OPRPs and CCPs ][1]{:target="_blank"}"  
This appendix supports the new and more descriptive requirements for handling of potential unsafe products (8.9.4) and release or disposition of nonconforming products.
