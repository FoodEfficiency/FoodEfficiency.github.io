After two exciting and challenging years as Global QEHS Manager, I have chosen to resign from my position at Palsgaard in favor of my own company as a senior consultant within the food industry.

Food Safety, Environment, Safety and Occupational Healty are still my focus areas. I have over 20 years of global experience in this field - all in the context of risk and oppurtinites for your the business, product development and sustainability - within the Global Food Supply Chain.

We offer both specialist consultancy and interim management role in Denmark and abroad.
