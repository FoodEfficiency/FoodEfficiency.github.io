In beginning of December, I participated in the EHEDG Advanced Course in Hygienic Design taking place in Amsterdam (NL). It was a very comprehensive four-day course with 16 delegates from Europe and South America, mostly representing food and cosmetic manufactures rather than equipment manufactures. 

![Ehedg][1]The key message I took with me, also based on my own experience, is the importance of focusing on the Functional Requirement and Total Cost of Ownership when investing in new equipment or upgrade to existing facility and processes. This also includes the expected lifetime of the process and equipment and potential new products trends (e.g. non-dairy). 

this concerns not only capacity and speed but just as important pH and temperature (in production and cleaning), salt% and types of fat and protein. Specially when going from dairy to non-dairy it is important to remember that different types of fat may have a significant impact on some types of gaskets.

Once successful this is where hygienic design goes hand in hand with high production efficiency, food safety, environmental protection and a safe workplace.
