From time to time, we experience outbreaks of pathogen bacteria, such as Listeria and Campylobacter among the human population. 

If the contamination is sporadic or not at all from the food manufacture it can be very difficult to deal with â€“ either identifying the root cause or proving the innocence of the food manufacture. 

Read our article on "[Outbreaks of infection and suspected cross-contamination at food manufacturing plants][1]" and keep in mind that after holidays or COVID-19 lock down, when all or part of the production may have been shut down, it is incredibly important to focus on not only the processing plant but also utilities and supplies for a safe restart of production.
