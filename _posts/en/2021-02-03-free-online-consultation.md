To celebrate our new energy efficient webpage we offer a 50 min free on-line video consultation to small and midium-size companies (up to 200 employees) on sustainability.

The offer is valid for small and mid-size companies who contact us in spring 2021.

You choose the area to talk about - my focus is the challenges and opportunities I see in your organization and in the supply chain / society, the UN's 17 world goals will be used as inspiration. You may be asked to share non-confidential information about your corporate politicians and market information prior to the meeting.

We use WEbex as a meeting platform and the meeting can take place in English or Danish. 

Registration is done using the contact form on our website. We look forward to seeing you online.
