Cleaning and control of cleaning and hygiene is essential to the food manufacturing industry. 

With increasing complexity of processes and equipment along with increasing demands on product quality and shelf life, failure of cleaning or failure of hygienic design quickly become critical. If such failure is not quickly detected and acted upon as it can result in extensive damage to both production and equipment, and in the worst case, the withdrawal of products.
